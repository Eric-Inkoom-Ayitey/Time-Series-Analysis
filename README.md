# üìà Time Series Analysis of Stock Prices

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that performs time series analysis on historical stock price data. The goal is to uncover underlying patterns such as trends, seasonality, and residual fluctuations using Python-based statistical techniques.

## üß† Objectives

- Visualize stock price movements over time
- Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components
- Apply moving average smoothing to highlight long-term patterns

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries

- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- statsmodels

## üìÇ File Structure

- `Time_Series_Analysis.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the analysis
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions
- `images/`: Folder to store visual outputs for documentation
