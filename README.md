# üìà Time Series Analysis: Stock Price Trends

This project presents a detailed time series analysis of selected stock price data using Python. The notebook explores temporal patterns, stationarity, decomposition, and smoothing techniques to uncover insights that support forecasting and investment decisions.

---

## 1. üß≠ Introduction

- **Problem Statement**: Understand and model the behavior of stock prices over time to identify trends, seasonality, and volatility.
- **Objectives**: Apply time series techniques to visualize, decompose, and smooth stock price data for actionable insights.
- **Data Source**: Historical stock price data retrieved from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance`.
- **Context**: Time series analysis is vital in financial modeling, risk management, and algorithmic trading. This project demonstrates intermediate-level techniques for exploring stock dynamics.

---

## 2. üßπ Data Preparation

- **Loading**: Stock data is loaded and organized into a pivot table.
- **Cleaning**: Missing values are handled, and date formats are standardized.
- **Validation**: Data ranges and completeness are verified across all selected stocks.

---

## 3. üìä Exploratory Analysis

- **Visualizations**: Individual and comparative time series plots are generated for each stock.
- **Statistics**: Summary metrics such as mean, variance, and price range are computed.
- **Patterns**: Initial trends and cyclical behaviors are identified visually.

## 4. üìâ Stationarity Analysis

- **ADF Test**: Augmented Dickey-Fuller test is applied to assess stationarity.
- **Visual Checks**: Rolling mean and standard deviation plots are used to support statistical findings.
- **Transformations**: Log transformations or differencing are suggested if non-stationarity is detected.

## 5. üîç Decomposition Analysis

- **Method**: `seasonal_decompose` from `statsmodels` is used to split the series into:
  - **Trend**
  - **Seasonality**
  - **Residuals**
- **Model Rationale**: Additive decomposition is chosen based on data characteristics.
- **Interpretation**: Each component is analyzed to understand its contribution to overall price movement.

## 6. üß† Advanced Analysis

- **Autocorrelation**: ACF and PACF plots are used to study lag dependencies.
- **Moving Average**: 30-day smoothing is applied to highlight long-term trends.
- **Seasonal Detection**: Repeating patterns are examined across months and quarters.

## 7. üíº Practical Applications

- **Investment Insights**: Trend analysis supports timing decisions for entry and exit.
- **Forecasting**: Decomposition and stationarity checks lay the groundwork for ARIMA or Prophet models.
- **Risk Management**: Understanding volatility and residual noise helps assess uncertainty.

---

## 8. üßæ Conclusion

- **Key Findings**:
  - Clear upward trends in selected stocks
  - Seasonal dips and spikes aligned with market cycles
  - Moderate residual noise indicating partial predictability
- **Limitations**:
  - No forecasting model implemented yet
  - Sentiment analysis not fully integrated
- **Recommendations**:
  - Extend with ARIMA or Prophet for forecasting
  - Integrate sentiment scores from news headlines or social media
  - Build an interactive dashboard for stakeholder presentation
